            <h2>Get a Beautiful Smile at Any Age</h2>
            <h4>How we can help.</h4>
            <h2>Orthodontics for Children</h2>
            <p>
            While there’s no minimum age for children to begin orthodontic treatment, the American
Association of Orthodontists recommends a child receive their first orthodontic
evaluation by around the age of seven. <br>
By this time, most children will have a mix of baby teeth and permanent teeth, making it
easier for orthodontists to diagnose and correct tooth and jaw problems before they
have the chance to become more severe. <br>

<h3>Only the best for your child</h3>
<h2>Orthodontics for children</h2>

<p>As a parent, you want the best for your child. That includes healthy teeth and a pleasing
smile. At Faces with Braces, our goal is to treat your children, by providing them with the
best possible orthodontics treatment options.</p> <br>
<h4>Kids Should Get an Orthodontic Check-Up by Age 7</h4>


<p>To have a smile that&#39;s long-lasting and healthy, your child needs teeth and jaws that are
properly aligned - in other words, a healthy bite. The American Association of
Orthodontists recommends that your child get an orthodontic check-up no later than age
seven.</p>
<p>By then, your child&#39;s teeth have developed enough for subtle problems with jaw growth
and emerging teeth to still be spotted while some baby teeth are still present. This
check-up may reveal that your child&#39;s bite is fine and braces for kids aren&#39;t necessary. <br>

Or, we may identify a developing problem but recommend monitoring your child&#39;s growth
and development, and then, if indicated, begin treatment at the appropriate time for your
child. In other cases, we might find a problem that can benefit from early treatment. <br>

What is Early Treatment?  Early treatment may prevent or intercept more serious
problems from developing and may make treatment at a later age shorter and less
complicated. In some cases, early treatment will be able to achieve results that may not
be possible once the face and jaws have finished growing.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h3>Choosing the Best Time for Orthodontics for Children</h3>
<p>While the age that kids get braces may vary, orthodontics for children most often begins
between the ages of 8 and 14. Some orthodontic problems are easier to correct if they
are treated early. <br>
This gives your orthodontist the best chance to: <br>
1. Guide jaw growth <br>
2. Lower the risk of trauma to protruded front teeth <br>
3. Correct harmful oral habits<br>
4. Improve appearance and self-esteem in your child<br>
5. Guide permanent teeth into a more favorable position<br>
6. Create a more pleasing arrangement of teeth, lips and face
<br>
<br>

Signs the Bite&#39;s Not Right: It&#39;s not always easy to tell when your child may need braces
or has an orthodontic problem. Even teeth that look straight may be hiding a problem
bite. Here are some clues that may indicate the need for orthodontic attention:
<br>
1. Early or late loss of baby teeth<br>
2. Difficulty chewing or biting<br>
3. Breathing through the mouth<br>
4. Thumb-sucking<br>
5. Crowded, misplaced or blocked-out teeth<br>
6. Jaws that are too far forward or back<br>
7. Biting the cheek or biting into the roof of the mouth<br>
8. Protruding teeth<br>
9. Upper and lower teeth that don&#39;t meet, or meet in an abnormal way<br>
10. An unbalanced facial appearance<br>
11. Grinding or clenching of the teeth<br>
</p>
<br>
<br>


<h3>Get Started</h3>

 <p>If your child has a dental issue, please come in for a consultation we&#39;d love to discuss
your child&#39;s orthodontic options and develop a treatment plan that is customized to your
child&#39;s needs.</p>


<br>
<h3>Orthodontics for Teens</h3>

<p>If your teen recently learned braces can improve their smile, you’re likely to have lots of
questions, and you may be feeling nervous or worried when you think about beginning
the process. Bulky, uncomfortable metal braces are a thing of the past.
<br> Today’s braces are smaller, sleeker, and far more comfortable than ever before. They
also come in a variety of styles, materials, and even colors.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>GET A BEAUTIFUL SMILE</h3>
<br>
<h2>Orthodontics for Teens</h2>
<p>The teen years (between the ages of 11 and 15) are the most common time for
orthodontic treatment because most permanent teeth will be in place. <br> <br>

Luckily, there are some new solutions that work to make the treatment process much
easier than ever before. <br> <br>

Some teens may have even started Phase I treatment at an earlier age, and are now
following it up with full braces or other orthodontic treatment. <br> <br>

Beyond outward appearances, untreated dental problems can have a lasting impact
on your teen’s oral and overall health. If you notice any of the following issues, we

recommend you come in for a consultation, since they could be signs your teen may
benefit from orthodontics treatment <br>
1. Early, late, or irregular loss of their baby teeth<br>
2. Difficulty with chewing or biting<br>
3. Crowding or extra spacing between teeth<br>
4. Jaws that shift or make sounds<br>
5. Frequent biting of the cheek or the inside of the mouth<br>
6. Teeth that meet abnormally or not at all<br>
7. Jaws and teeth that are out of proportion to the rest of the face<br>
8. Protrusion of teeth.</p><br>

<h4>Bad Bites</h4>
<p>Diagnosing and successfully treating certain bite problems can have short-term and
long-term benefits. Problems classified as “bad bites” can often be minimized with the
proper orthodontic treatment, including: <br>
1. Crooked or crowded teeth <br>
2. Missing or extra teeth<br>
3. An overbite or underbite<br>
4. Incorrect jaw position<br>
5. A disorder of the jaw joint</p><br>

<br>
<h4>Benefits of Orthodontics for Teens</h4>

<p>Straight teeth that respond well to orthodontics for teens treatment carry a number of
benefits, including: <br>
1. Being less prone to wear and tear, chipping, and tooth trauma<br>
2. Being easier to keep clean, helping to prevent tooth decay and cavities<br>
3. Reducing the chances of developing gum disease, which can result in bone loss,
decay, and tooth loss<br>
4. Improving proper chewing and digestion of food</p><br>

                  This is a question with no concrete answer. Every case is different, but the average
                  length of the active stage of orthodontic treatment for teens is anywhere from 6 to 36
                  months. <br>
                  <br>
                  
                  After this phase of treatment is complete, your teen will need to wear a retainer for as
                  long as Dr.Cynthia feels is necessary based on their individual case. We work as a team
                  with both parents and teen to create a smile that will last a lifetime.

                  Absolutely. If your teen athlete is wearing more traditional braces, it’s crucial to protect
                  their smile in order to stay on track with their treatment. We strongly recommend that
                  they use an orthodontic mouthguard to protect their braces, and their mouth, from any
                  potential injury. Your teen can play any contact sport if they use the proper orthodontic
                  mouthguard. <br>
                  
                  If your teen has Invisalign, teens using this system can simply take their aligner out
                  before practice or a game, and put it back in afterwards.

                  Traditional metal braces might affect the way your teen plays some instruments.
                  Invisalign is an excellent alternative orthodontics for teens treatment because removing
                  their aligner before playing gives them no limitations..

          <h2>Orthodontics for Adults

            </h2>
            <p>Orthodontic treatment isn’t just for children and teens. One in every five orthodontic
            patients is over the age of 21. <br>
            
            Many adults are choosing to receive treatment later in life because they understand the
            importance of maintaining their oral health, they want to feel better about their overall
            appearance, or both.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5>Because it’s never too late to get the smile of your dreams</h5>
            <br>
<h2>ADULT ORTHODONTICS</h2>
            <p>If you&#39;re thinking about adult orthodontics, you are not alone. Currently, one of every five
patients in orthodontic treatment is an adult. Most adult orthodontic issues can be
corrected. <br> 
</p>
<br> <br>
<h3>Providing the most up-to-date orthodontic solutions
for adults</h3>
<p>At Faces with Braces we offer multiple orthodontic treatment choices for adult patients
and will suggest the best solution for your particular needs and desires. One choice you
probably already know about is Invisalign®, which aligns teeth with removable, custom-
made and clear aligners. <br>
<br>

Since invisalign aligners are removable, you can take out your Invisalign aligners when
you floss, brush or eat. <br> <br>

We understand that even though you want a nicer smile, you may be putting off braces
because you feel that Invisalign is a more expensive option and you do not want the look
of metal brackets on your teeth. <br> <br>

Fortunately, they can use clear cosmetic braces, which are an outstanding choice if
you’re concerned about your appearance since they are practically invisible. Clear
cosmetic braces are constructed of ceramic materials that are exceptionally durable;
they are also resilient to staining.<br> <br>

If all other options are exhausted, traditional metal brackets are still an option. The most-
modern nickel-titanium archwires are used with all types of brackets. These archwires
are temperature-sensitive and use a continuous, gentle force for more effective tooth
movement and less discomfort.<br> <br>

Remember, it&#39;s not too late to achieve your dream smile. Call Faces with Braces to
schedule your orthodontic consultation today</p>
