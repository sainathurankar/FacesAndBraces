        <h2>AFFORDABLE PAYMENTS</h2>
        <br>

<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>Just as all of us are different, the orthodontic issues we have are also different. This
means that our fees depend on the difficulty of your treatment, appliances required and
time in treatment. <br>
<br>

When we determine your orthodontic care plan we can discuss the financial plan that
works for you.</p>
<br> <br>

<h3>Payment Plans</h3>

<p>Orthodontic treatment is an investment that will benefit you for a lifetime. Because we
believe finances shouldn’t get in the way of achieving a healthy, beautiful smile, we offer
a variety of payment options. <br> <br>

These options include a discount for payment in full prior to starting treatment as well as
a variety of interest-free and no-down payment options. <br> <br>

For your added convenience, we accept all major credit cards and can set up automatic
deductions. <br> <br>

We are more than willing to work with you to achieve the beautiful, healthy smile you
deserve.</p><br> <br>


 <h2>Individualized Treatments Plans</h2>


<p>Your initial appointment will consist of a thorough examination and a
discussion of potential treatment options. We may also reserve time
following the exam to take some diagnostic records. The records may
include X-rays, photos and impressions for study models that we need so
we can create your customized treatment plan. This will last approximately
one hour. <br> <br>
This important one-hour visit will give us insight into your orthodontic
needs. We know your time is valuable.</p><br> <br>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>We believe it’s important to analyse specific needs of each patient because
in-depth planning leads to superior results and higher patient satisfaction.
We will then schedule a consultation visit to discuss treatment options, time
frames and financial arrangements. <br> <br>
We insist that our patients leave the office with a clear understanding of
their specific needs, what the treatment will consist of and how long it will
take. Also, we will answer any additional questions.<br> <br>
Then you’ll choose the type of braces you want—traditional metal, clear
braces, or Invisalign.<br> <br>
Our goal at Faces with Braces is not just to give you the smile of your
dreams. We want you to leave our office after every appointment knowing
that you got the best possible care</p><br> <br>

<h2>Same Day Treatment</h2>

<br> <br>
<h2>Personal Customer Service</h2>
<p>From the moment you contact our office to your final retainer check
appointment, our goal at Faces with Braces is your complete satisfaction. <br> <br>
After the initial examination and taking of diagnostic records, Dr.Cynthia will
review your photos and X-rays to find the best way to treat your individual
needs followed by a discussion of potential treatment options</p>
<br> <br>

<h3>Bring These Things</h3>
<p>Please assist us by providing the following information at the time of your
first visit:<br> 
1. Any panoramic X-ray taken within the past six months.<br> 
2. Any prior dental treatment and corresponding records.</p>

<br> <br>
<h2>Start Your Treatment the Same Day</h2>
<p>Your orthodontic treatment journey involves a series of orthodontic visits,
but we value the relationship that we will build with you and your family
throughout that process. We want you to feel confident you’re receiving the
best orthodontic care.<br> <br>
We value your time, and we know you want to make the most of your visit.
Once you feel like we&#39;ve answered all of your questions and concerns, you
can start your treatment that same day!</p>
